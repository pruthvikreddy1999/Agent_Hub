📚 Agentic RAG AI Agent (n8n Workflow)

This AI agent is an automated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with n8n and integrated with Google Drive, Pinecone, and Google Gemini. It enables real-time question answering based on documents uploaded or updated in a specific Google Drive folder.

🚀 Features

- Watches a Google Drive folder for new or updated files
- Loads and splits documents into chunks
- Embeds the chunks using Google Gemini Embedding API
- Stores the vectorized data in Pinecone Vector Database
- Uses Google Gemini Chat Model for intelligent, context-aware Q&A
- Responds to chat messages using retrieved context (RAG-style)
- Outputs answers with additional formatting or custom logic via a code node

🧩 Workflow Structure

🔁 Trigger Nodes
- File Created / Updated (Google Drive): Watches a folder and initiates vector embedding flow.
- Chat Message Received: Accepts user queries.

📄 Document Processing Flow
1. Default Data Loader: Ingests binary documents from Drive.
2. Recursive Character Text Splitter: Splits documents into smaller chunks for efficient embedding.
3. Google Gemini Embedding: Generates vector embeddings.
4. Pinecone Vector Store: Stores embedded vectors into a Pinecone index.

🧠 RAG QA Flow
1. Vector Store Retriever: Pulls relevant chunks based on query.
2. Google Gemini Chat Model: Provides natural language answers.
3. Question and Answer Chain: Formats the final response with context.
4. Code Node: Structures the output to return only the answer.
